Anticipating the next release of macOS (10.16; Big Sur), I started to read the novel [Big Sur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur_(novel)) by Jack Kerouac. It's very interesting to me that in Chapter 12, Kerouac went to visit [Neal Cassady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Cassady), who was living in the Santa Clara Valley (more precisely, 1047 E. Santa Clara Street). So, in the late 50's, Neal Cassady was practically living in today's Silicon Valley. I had never associated with Silicon Valley with the counterculture movement. I found a couple of articles about Beat figures in the Silicon Valley. [Al Hinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hinkle), for example, lived in San Jose. Jack Kerouac's early introduction to Buddhism was apparently from a book that he stoled from San Jose's public library.
