I like this little episode in Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_. In Chapter 53, one of the main characters Casaubon, a scholar of European history, unexpectedly ran into Inspector De Angelis in a library. He was surprised that the policeman checked out the same book that he was looking for. Why are you reading such an esoteric book? The policeman answered: "... when I'm off duty, I like to browse in libraries. It keeps me from turning into a robot, a mechanical cop".
