In _V._, Chapter 14, Pynchon made passing references to the [Dreyfus Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair?wprov=sfti1) - a social controversy that divided France near the end of the 19th century.  Just by coincidence, I read something about it earlier this year. The Father Brown story "The Duel of Dr Hirsch" by G.K. Chesterton is a very odd detective story, because it's really a commentary on the Dreyfus Affairs.

The other historical figure that plays a more significant role in _V._ is [Charles Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon?wprov=sfti1) - the British military officer who was killed in the Siege of Khartoum in 1885. Some of the characters in the novel might have encountered Sherlock Holmes because according to _The Adventure of the Empty House_, Holmes visited Khartoum after The Final Problem (1891)! In _The Adventure of the Cardboard Box_, it was revealed that Dr. Watson had a portrait of Charles Gordon in his house.
