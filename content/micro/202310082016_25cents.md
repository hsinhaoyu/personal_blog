A friend shared with me a photo of a sign that says "Brains 25c Drive In".  It's on the cover of the Bill Frisell album _Where in the World?_ (1991), and [many other places](https://dfarq.homeip.net/brains-25-cents-the-story-behind-the-meme/).  It was a real sign advertising a fried brain sandwich, found in St. Louis, Misouri in the 70's and 80's.
