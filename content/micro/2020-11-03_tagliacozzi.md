In Thomas Pynchon's first novel [V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.?wprov=sfti1), there is a subplot involving rhinoplasty. A surgeon in the story (“being a conservative”) refers to his own profession as the “Art of Tagliacozzi”. This is reference to the 16th century surgeon [Gaspare Tagliacozzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspare_Tagliacozzi?wprov=sfti1), who pioneered surgical techniques for nasal reconstruction. He was a professor of anatomy at the [Archiginnasio of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archiginnasio_of_Bologna?wprov=sfti1), whose famous anatomical theatre houses a statue of Tagliacozzi holding a nose. I visited Bologna in 2015. I noticed a statue of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen?wprov=sfti1) in the theatre, but at that time, didn't know about Tagliacozzi.📚
