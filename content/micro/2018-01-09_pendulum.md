The plot of Umberto Eco's novel _Foucault's Pendulum_ involves two publishers: Garamond and Manutius. Both names refer to figures in the history of printing: [Claude Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond) designed the Garamond font in the 16th century, while [Aldus Manutius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius) was a famous 15th century printer who invented italic type, a few punctuation marks, and the pocketbook format. This might be a joke because both names are relatable to Apple. The Garamond font was used in Apple's logo, and Aldus Co. was the original developer of PageMaker (a killer app for the Macintosh) before it was acquired by Adobe.
