In _Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_, Borges discovered an important clue about the secrets of _Tlön_ when he found a letter hidden in a book:

> In March of 1941, a handwritten letter from Gunnar Erfjord was discovered in a book by Hinton that had belonged to Herbert Ashe.

Gunnar Erfjord and Herber Ashe are both fictional characters who are members of the _Orbis Tertius_ secret society, but who is Hinton? Hinton is mentioned only once in the entire story, so he must be a historical figure. But which Hiton is so famous that he could be referred to just by the last name?

Interestingly, it is the mathematician [Charles Howard Hintin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Howard_Hinton), whose fictional and non-fictional writings had inspired the public's interest in the fourth dimension. He was name-checked in two other stories by Borges (_The Secret Miracle_ and _There Are More Things_), and was mentioned by H.P. Lovecraft and Aleister Crowley.
