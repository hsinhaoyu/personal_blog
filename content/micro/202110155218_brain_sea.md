This is an illustration of the "Brain Sea". I found it near the end of a comic book by the Taiwanese artist [Push](https://pushcomic.pixnet.net/blog). What is the Brain Sea? In Mandarin Chinese, "Brain Sea" (腦海) is a common expression that refers to the mind. This is the end scene of the "Nine Lives Man" saga, where the protagonist (who has been reincarnated into countless life forms in the 3-volume Sci-Fi series) asks the ultimate question: What is the point of all this? The answer is that it's all in the brain sea of Push, the comic book author. The next page shows the author finishing the final panel, and he thinks to himself: "What a crappy ending! Who will buy this very serious but also very silly book?"
