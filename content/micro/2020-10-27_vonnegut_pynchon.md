It’s interesting that two favourite writers  of mine had worked for big tech companies. Kurt Vonnegut worked for the PR department of GE. His portrayal of the genius scientist in _Cat’s Cradle_ was based on his interview of Nobel Laureate [Irving Langmuir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Langmuir) of GE Research. Thomas Pynchon was a tech writer for Boeing. Yoyodyne, a defence contractor in  _The Crying of Lot 49_, is a caricature of Boeing.

Dec 4th 2020 update: I also learned that [William Gaddis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gaddis) worked for Kodak and IBM.
