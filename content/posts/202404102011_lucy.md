Today I visited the National Natural History Museum in Taichung, and I found the exact location where I was introduced to the music of the Beatles!

It was a school excursion when I was a boy. In the anthropological hall of the museum, there was a display of the site in Ethiopia where Donald Johanson discovered Australopithecus. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was playing because that’s the music Johanson was listening to while his team dug up Lucy. I actually paid no attention to any of these facts, because I was listening to the music. After that excursion, I bought Beatles albums one by one until I found Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

I returned to the museum after decades living abroad, and I was very happy to have discovered that the museum has been playing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds continuously all these years.
