I've been reading the memoir of composer and musicologist [Colin McPhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McPhee), _A House in Bali_.  In the 30's, he transcribed some of the music that he heard in Bali for the piano.

The first of his Balinese Ceremonial Music is _Pemoengkah_ - music for the _wayang kulit_, or the Balinese shadow puppet theatre.  The Balinese version can be heard in _Nonesuch Explorer Series - Bali: Music For The Shadow Play_ album.  It sounds very different, but the melody in McPhee's transcription can be heard close to the end of the track (around 14:00).
